# Globetrotter Wordpress Theme

Globetrotter is a modern Wordpress theme for anyone who loves travelling!

With featues such as "Planned Trips" and "Places Visited", Globetrotter will easily help you display your adventures on interactive map charts.

An demo sample of the theme can be viewed at https://codeant.se

## How to install:

As any other Wordpress theme, Globetrotter can be activated from the Wordpress admin panel by cloning the repo to your path-to-wp-installation/wp-content/themes/.
Optionally, you can download the theme as a .zip file and uploading the compressed file in the Wordpress admin panel.

As the Globetrotter theme currently is in development, there are still some featues that needs to be added or refined. Those features include post tags, better comment styling and some more layout options.
Note however that all major features already are included in the theme.
